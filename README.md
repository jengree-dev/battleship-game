# Battleship Game
A classic **Battleship game** implemented with **HTML, CSS, and jQuery**.
Originally created as a **test assignment** for a developer position (which I successfully got) and used to demostrate my skills in front-end development and game logic design.
Now kept as a **legacy project** to demonstrate my early experience in both **front-end development** and **algorithmic problem-solving**.
